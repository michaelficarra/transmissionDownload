{"name":"TransmissionDownload","body":"Transmission Torrent Downloader\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nOn any supported page (which currently includes the Torrentz individual torrent\r\npages and any page containing a magnet link), a [chrome page\r\naction](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/pageAction.html) will be made\r\navailable to aid in the torrent starting process.\r\n\r\n![chrome page action](https://github.com/michaelficarra/transmissionDownload/raw/master/images/screenshots/pageAction.png)\r\n\r\nWhen clicked, a chrome \"popup\" will be displayed. The target server will be\r\ndisplayed at the top. Press the button to initiate the torrent-adding process.\r\n\r\n![initiate torrent download](https://github.com/michaelficarra/transmissionDownload/raw/master/images/screenshots/addTorrent.png)\r\n\r\nYou will see a stream of status messages followed by either a green success\r\nmessage or a red error message. In the event that a green success message was\r\noutput, the torrent should now be added to the transmission server.\r\n\r\n![successful output](https://github.com/michaelficarra/transmissionDownload/raw/master/images/screenshots/output.png)\r\n\r\n*Note:* This extension requires the Transmission HTTP RPC. This can be enabled [through\r\nthe preferences\r\nGUI](http://www.transmissionbt.com/help/gtk/2.2x/html/preferences.html#web)\r\nwhen using transmission-gtk or by setting the `rpc-enabled` and related `rpc-*`\r\nvalues in transmission-daemon's `settings.json` file when using transmission-daemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Adds torrents to a transmission server (remote or local)\r\n* (optionally) Adds all trackers from tracker aggregation websites\r\n* Saves and optionally encrypts login information\r\n\r\n  ![encryption prompt](https://github.com/michaelficarra/transmissionDownload/raw/master/images/screenshots/encryption.png)\r\n\r\n* Adds additional, specified trackers to each torrent\r\n\r\n![options page](https://github.com/michaelficarra/transmissionDownload/raw/master/images/screenshots/options.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n0.

Accept security warnings\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n* warn on attempted use without required settings such as invalid host/port\r\n* test on transmission server that doesn't use authentication\r\n* use proper node function signatures (first argument should be `err`)\r\n\t* handle errors by adding retry button (must be using node style callback signatures first)\r\n* change `addTorrent` signature to accept URLs, not `info_hash`es\r\n\t* move looping/retrying behaviour from `addTorrent` to event handler\r\n\t* add support for adding torrents by torrent download URL (for private torrents)\r\n\t* add contextual menu for any link: \"Send to Transmission ==(submenu)=> http://host:port/path\"\r\n* don't make user type in password repeatedly (send request to background page to store password in closure for X seconds)\r\n* don't require save button on options page\r\n* find a way to test this thing\r\n* leopard shortcut\r\n* standardize element id naming convention (underscore or camel case)\r\n* find a way to make it continue even if popup is closed (web worker? do the work in the background page?)\r\n* publicize\r\n* go to transmission web interface (on torrent add) if tab is already open (see [goToInbox function](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/extensions/gmail/background.html?content-type=text/plain))\r\n* modularize and DRY up everything\r\n\t* function for trying an XHR with an array of inputs until we make a function pass\r\n\t* function for sending an arguments object and a method to a transmission server\r\n* see if I can add a context menu item for the page action that opens the web interface\r\n* add support for multiple servers (don't forget to no longer cache the session ID as a single value!)\r\n* rewrite in CoffeeScript\r\n* think about allowing generic handler to find any 40-character hex string anywhere\r\n* insert icons next to search results for extra accessibility (optional, defaulting to disabled)\r\n* (permanent) write handlers for some more torrent websites without magnet links or with better alternatives\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building / Releasing\r\n\r\n0.
