TODO (before release)
---------------------

* initiate transmission RPC connection (see 2.4 of [spec](https://trac.transmissionbt.com/browser/trunk/extras/rpc-spec.txt))
* send torrent url to transmission RPC, retrieve torrent ID
* send additional trackers to transmission RPC (requires torrent ID)
* write handlers for some more torrent websites without magnet links or with better alternatives
* think about writing a generic handler for any 40-character hex string anywhere
* insert icons next to torrentz search results
* go to transmission web interface (on torrent add) if tab is already open (see [goToInbox function](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/extensions/gmail/background.html?content-type=text/plain))
* (research) try to make use of chrome's built-in password system instead of using my own (even though it's awesome)
* (research) inspect [license of icon file](http://www.veryicon.com/icons/system/arcade-daze-apps-vol-1/transmission-2.html)
